# odin-recipes

This repository is a guided project from "The Odin Project"

It is one of the first lessons in creating a website using HTML, and specifically aims to be a basic page that has a few links to different recipies. It covers the fundamentals of HTML syntax, like how to set up a body of text with paragraphs, text, and links.
